Project Name: Ticker

Project Goals:
To create a program what will take one comand line argument which is a text file that has stock information in it. Then the program must take input from STDIN, this input will be differences in the stock. Then the program must output the original stock information, modified by what was taking in by STDIN.

Considerations:
Maybe putting original stock info and the STDIN info in two seperate trees. Then combining.

Design:
All the tree handling will be done in the tree library. The actual program will be made in ticker.c. It will first check to see if a valid command line argument was given. If it was valid, it will open the file and see if it is a valid file. If it is, it will then start interpreting the data and place it in a tree. Then the program will ask for input from STDIN. It will try to interpret any data passed via STDIN and put it in a seperate tree. After all the data is interpreted, i will then combine the trees and output the new stock prices. 

Data Flow:
Check for valid command line arg

Check file passed in command line arg

Add data in file pass to a tree

Get STDIN

Add data in STDIN to a tree

Combine trees

Output data from new tree
